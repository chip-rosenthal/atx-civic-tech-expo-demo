This package contains the website for a table we provided
at the Texas Digital Government Summit, June 2014.

It is a static website, with document root at the "html" directory.

The content is generated from "rhtml" templates, in the "src/pages"
directory. To rebuild the content, simply run "rake".

This branch is forked from the "city-hall-expo-2013" branch,
in the atx-civic-tech-expo-web project.
